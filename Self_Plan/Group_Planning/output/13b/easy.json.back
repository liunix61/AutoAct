Since Ptolemy, knowledge of the approximate size of the Earth allowed cartographers to estimate the extent of their geographical knowledge, and to indicate parts of the planet known to exist but not yet explored as terra incognita.With the Age of Discovery, during the 15th to 18th centuries, world maps became increasingly accurate; exploration of Antarctica, Australia, and the interior of Africa by western mapmakers was left to the 19th and early 20th century.\nThought: Let's try to find more information about the movie's director.\nAction: Lookup[Yeon Sang-ho]\nObservation: No Results\nThought: Let's try to find more information about the movie's cast.\nAction: Lookup[The Map Against the World cast]\nObservation: No Results\nThought: Let's try to find more information about the movie's release date.\nAction: Lookup[The Map Against the World release date]\nObservation: No Results\nThought: Let's try to find more information about the movie's plot.\nAction: Lookup[The Map Against the World plot]\nObservation: No Results\nThought: Let's try to find more information about the movie's production company.\nAction: Lookup[The Map Against the World production company]\nObservation: No Results\nThought: Let's try to find more information about the movie's director's other works.\nAction: Lookup[Yeon Sang-ho other works]\nObservation: No Results"}

You may take as many steps as necessary.\nQuestion: Prince William, Duke of Gloucester and Prince George of Denmark, were eventually monarchs of which Kingdom?\n\n\nThought: This is a historical question. Let's first use BingSearch to find relevant information.\nAction: BingSearch[history of the British monarchy]\nObservation: The origins of the English monarchy lie in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries. In the 7th century, the Anglo-Saxons consolidated into seven kingdoms known as the Heptarchy. At certain times, one king was strong enough to claim the title bretwalda ( Old English for &quot;over-king&quot;). [3]The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch shares power with a constitutionally organized government. The reigning king or queen is the country\u2019s head of state. All political power rests with the prime minister (the head of government) and the cabinet, and the monarch must act on their advice.There have been 63 monarchs of England and Britain spread over a period of approximately 1200 years. English Kings SAXON KINGS EGBERT 827 \u2013 839 Egbert (Ecgherht) was the first monarch to establish a stable and extensive rule over all of Anglo-Saxon England.The British monarchy traces its origins from the petty kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England and early medieval Scotland, which consolidated into the kingdoms of England and Scotland by the 10th century. England was conquered by the Normans in 1066, after which Wales also gradually came under the control of Anglo-Normans.\nThought: Based on the information from BingSearch, it seems that Prince William, Duke of Gloucester and Prince George of Denmark were not monarchs of the United Kingdom.\nAction: Retrieve[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]\nObservation: Prince William, Duke of Gloucester (24 July 1689 \u2013 30 July 1700), was the son of Princess Anne (later Queen of England, Ireland and Scotland from 1702) and her husband, Prince George of Denmark. He was their only child to survive infancy. Styled Duke of Gloucester, he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the \"Glorious Revolution\" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather James II & VII the previous year.Anne was estranged from her brother-in-law and cousin, William III & II, and her sister, Mary II, but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle William, who created him a Knight of the Garter, and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents. At his nursery in Campden House, Kensington, he befriended his Welsh body-servant, Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of the Duke is an important source for historians, and operated his own miniature army, called the \"Horse Guards\", which eventually comprised 90 boys.Gloucester's precarious health was a constant source of worry to his mother.

Known for his marriage to (and being the widower of) Amelia Earhart, he had also achieved fame as one of the most successful promoters in the United States during the 1930s. Early lifeGeorge Palmer Putnam (February 7, 1814 \u2013 December 20, 1872) was an American publisher and author. He founded the firm G. P. Putnam&#39;s Sons and Putnam&#39;s Magazine. He was an advocate of international copyright reform, secretary for many years of the Publishers&#39; Association, and founding superintendent of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Early lifeEarhart&#39;s husband, George P. Putnam, was someone of note as well, although the history books have largely relegated him to a footnote in the story of his flashier (and, ultimately, more mysterious) wife.George Palmer Putnam was a publisher, explorer, and aviator who led two expeditions to the Artic and wrote books on aviation and exploration. He was the third and last child of G. P. Putnam&#39;s Sons founder John Bishop and Frances Faulkner Putnam. He married four times, including to Amelia Earhart, and died in 1950.\nThought: Based on the observation, it seems that George Palmer Putnam was married to Amelia Earhart. Let's use Retrieve to confirm this.\nAction: Retrieve[Amelia Earhart]\nObservation: Amelia Mary Earhart ( AIR-hart; July 24, 1897; disappeared July 2, 1937; declared dead January 5, 1939) was an American aviation pioneer and writer. Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She set many other records, was one of the first aviators to promote commercial air travel, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences, and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.Born and raised in Atchison, Kansas, and later in Des Moines, Iowa, Earhart developed a passion for adventure at a young age, steadily gaining flying experience from her twenties. In 1928, Earhart became the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane (accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz), for which she achieved celebrity status. In 1932, piloting a Lockheed Vega 5B, Earhart made a nonstop solo transatlantic flight, becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat. She received the United States Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment. In 1935, Earhart became a visiting faculty member at Purdue University as an advisor to aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to female students. She was also a member of the National Woman's Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. Known as one of the most inspirational American figures in aviation from the late 1920s throughout the 1930s, Earhart's legacy is often compared to the early aeronautical career of pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, as well as to figures like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt for their close friendship and lasting impact on the issue of women's causes from that period.During an attempt at becoming the first woman to complete a circumnavigational flight of the globe in 1937 in a Purdue-funded Lockheed Model 10-E Electra, Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. The two were last seen in Lae, New Guinea, on July 2, 1937, on the last land stop before Howland Island and one of their final legs of the flight. It is generally presumed that she and Noonan died somewhere in the Pacific during the circumnavigation, just three weeks prior to her fortieth birthday. Nearly one year and six months after she and Noonan disappeared, Earhart was officially declared dead. Investigations and significant public interest in their disappearance still continue over 80 years later.Decades after her presumed death, Earhart was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1968 and the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1973. She now has several commemorative memorials named in her honor around the United States, including a commemorative US airmail stamp, an urban park, an airport, a residence hall, a museum, a research foundation, a bridge, a cargo ship, an earth-fill dam, four schools, a hotel, a playhouse, a library, multiple roads, and more. She also has a minor planet, planetary corona, and newly-discovered lunar crater named after her. She is ranked ninth on Flying's list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.\nThought: Based on the information, it seems that George Palmer Putnam was married to Amelia Earhart.
