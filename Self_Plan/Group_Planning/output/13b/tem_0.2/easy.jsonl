Each winner is indicated below.In 1965, Academy President Rod Serling initiated \"Area Awards\" that narrowed the categories to a select few and allowed for multiple winners in an attempt to foster less competition in favor of more programs and individuals receiving credit for their work.

Developed for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), it is derived from a combination of techniques used in aikido, judo, karate, boxing, and wrestling. It is known for its focus on real-world situations and its extreme efficiency. Krav Maga was originally developed by Hungarian-born Israeli martial artist Imi Lichtenfeld. Having grown up in Bratislava during a time of anti-Semitic unrest, Lichtenfeld used his training as a boxer and wrestler to defend Jewish neighborhoods against attackers in the mid-to-late 1930s, becoming an experienced street fighter. After his immigration to Mandatory Palestine in the late 1940s, he began to provide lessons on combat training to Jewish paramilitary groups that would later form the IDF during the 1948 Palestine war. As an instructor, he compiled his knowledge and experience into the combat system that would later become known as Krav Maga. This system would continue to be taught long after he left the IDF.From the outset, the original concept of Krav Maga was to take the most effective and practical techniques of other fighting styles (originally European boxing, wrestling, and street fighting) and make them rapidly teachable to conscripted soldiers. It has a philosophy emphasizing aggression and simultaneous defensive and offensive manoeuvres. It has been used by Israeli special forces and regular infantry units alike. Closely related variations have been developed and adopted by Israeli law enforcement and intelligence organizations, and there are several organizations teaching variations of Krav Maga internationally.  There are two forms of Krav Maga, with one type adapted for Israeli security forces and the other type adapted for civilian use.\nThought: I think I have found the answer to the question.\nAction: Finish[Imi Lichtenfeld]\nObservation: Please reflect your answer.\nThought: Hmm, I think my answer is correct.\nAction: Reflect[right]\nObservation: Answer is INCORRECT"}

The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine.

The park is roughly evenly divided between Tennessee and North Carolina, and is located within portions of Blount, Sevier, and Cocke Counties in Tennessee, and Swain and Haywood Counties in North Carolina. Elevations in the park range from about 875 feet (267 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park, 16 mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m). Clingmans Dome is also the highest mountain in Tennessee and the third-highest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Mount Le Conte, at an elevation of 6,593 feet (2,010 m), rises 5,301 feet (1,616 m) from is base to its summit, making it the tallest mountain in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. The wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States.The Little Tennessee River runs along the southwestern border of the park, which is impounded by Chilhowee Dam, Calderwood Dam, Cheoah Dam, and Fontana Dam along the boundary. This river separates the Great Smoky Mountains range from the Unicoi Mountains to the west. The Pigeon River flows through a deep gorge near the eastern boundary of the park, separating the range from the Bald Mountains to the west. Several smaller rivers have their source in the park, including the three prongs of the Little Pigeon River, the Oconaluftee River, and the Little River. The park is located entirely within the Tennessee Valley, the watershed of the Tennessee River. Other major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near Oconaluftee, Cosby Creek near Cosby, and Roaring Fork near Gatlinburg. The park borders an Indian reservation to the south that is home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally-recognized tribe who are descended from a small group of Cherokee who evaded the forced migration of the Cherokee people to present-day Oklahoma.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery The Mousetrap, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. Guinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.According to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author. Her novel And Then There Were None is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, Witness for the Prosecution received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, And Then There Were None was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Many of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\nThought: K\u014db\u014d Abe and Agatha Christie are both mystery authors.\nAction: Finish[mystery authors]\nObservation: Please reflect your answer.\nThought: The answer is correct.\nAction: Reflect[right]\nObservation: Answer is INCORRECT"}

Sichuan's capital city is Chengdu. The population of Sichuan stands at 83 million. Sichuan neighbors are Qinghai to the northwest, Gansu to the north, Shaanxi to the northeast, Chongqing (historically part of Sichuan until the late 20th century) to the east, Guizhou to the southeast, Yunnan to the south, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the west.In antiquity, Sichuan was the home of the ancient state of Ba and the ancient kingdom of Shu. Their conquest by Qin strengthened it and paved the way for Qin Shi Huang's unification of China under the Qin dynasty. During the Three Kingdoms era, Liu Bei's state of Shu was based in Sichuan. The area was devastated in the 17th century by Zhang Xianzhong's rebellion and the area's subsequent Manchu conquest, but recovered to become one of China's most productive areas by the 19th century. During World War II, Chongqing served as the temporary capital of the Republic of China, making it the focus of the Japanese bombing. It was one of the last mainland areas captured by the People's Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952, with Chongqing restored two years later. It suffered gravely during the Great Chinese Famine of 1959\u201361 but remained China's most populous province until Chongqing Municipality was again separated from it in 1997.The Han Chinese people of Sichuan speak distinctive Sichuanese dialects of Mandarin Chinese.

[5] [4] No. Title. Artist. Year.\nThought: The song must be from a well-known artist or band.\nAction: Retrieve[Smashing Pumpkins]\nObservation: The Smashing Pumpkins (or simply Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman and guitarist Billy Corgan, bassist D'arcy Wretzky, guitarist  James Iha, and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, the band has undergone several line-up changes since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, and Iha.Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their contemporaries, the band has a diverse, densely layered sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, grunge, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, dream pop and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical versatility and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's distinctive albums, which one writer described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\". With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s, often cited as a cultural touchstone of Generation X, and as an important act in the popularization of alternative rock. However, internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales led to a break-up in 2000.In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope\u2014Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released the album Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun. (2018), Cyr (2020) and Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts in three increments across 2022 and 2023. Schroeder departed the band in October 2023.\nThought: The song must be the title of an album or a single.\nAction: Lookup[1979]\nObservation: (Result 1/3) === Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness: 1995\u20131997 ===During 1995, Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \"The Wall for Generation X\", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as \"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\". The album spawned five singles\u2014\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\", \"1979\", \"Zero\", \"Tonight, Tonight\" which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song \"I'll Be with You Tonight\", and \"Thirty-Three\"\u2014of which the first three were certified gold and all but \"Zero\" entered the Top 40. Many of the songs that did not make it onto Mellon Collie were released as B-sides to the singles, and were later compiled in The Aeroplane Flies High box set. The set was originally limited to 200,000 copies, but more were produced to meet demand.In 1996 the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of Mellon Collie. Corgan's look during this period\u2014a shaved head, a long-sleeve black shirt with the word \"Zero\" printed on it, and silver pants\u2014became iconic. That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of The Simpsons, \"Homerpalooza\". With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and \"Zero\" shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time.In May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band's repeated requests for moshing to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O'Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her. However, while Corgan maintained that moshing's \"time [had] come and gone\", the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.The band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident. The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation. Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he'd \"gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe.\" But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, \"For nine years we have battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. \u2026 We wish [him] the best we have to offer\". Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of Mellon Collie stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record, and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, \"The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music.\"\nThought: The song is a single from the album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\nAction: Finish[1979]\nObservation: Please reflect your answer.\nThought: The answer is correct.\nAction: Reflect[right]\nObservation: Answer is INCORRECT"}
